Spices ! they're good for the soul but
they're also good for our bodies 

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.300
Hey guys! Tara here for Dnews and if
you're a person who enjoys cooking or


3
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.000
eating then you'll be happy to know that
many of the spices we use in our food


4
00:00:12.050  --> 00:00:14.550
everyday can also 
have very real health benefits.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
A new study from the Rush
University Medical Center finds that


6
00:00:18.500 -->  00:00:21.000
cinnamon can actually reverse the
anatomical changes that occur


7
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.000
in the brains of mice with 
Parkinson's disease.


8
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.000
Cinnamon has long been known to be great
for your health it's loaded with antioxidants

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 and it's especially helpful for people with type 
2 diabetes 
 

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.000
A 2010 study found that consuming two grams of
cinnamon 

11
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.000
 every day for 12 weeks significantly lowered patient's blood
pressure  


12
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.000
and blood sugar levels. 
In another study from that same year
  

13
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.000
found that cinnamon extract can actually 
increase insulin sensitivity

14
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
 and improve hyperglycemia in mice 


15
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.000
turmeric for example which is found in a
lot of Indian food 

16
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
may actually help fight cancer 


17
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
it contains an antioxidant
called curcumin 

18
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that's been shown to enhance the effectiveness 
of chemo in patients with breast cancer

19
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
so much in fact that it's now being 
considered as a possible drug supplement

20
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.003
for chemotherapy it's also been shown to
suppress the specific cell pathway

21
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that's known to fuel the growth of head
and neck cancer 

22
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.000
rosemary has also been shown to minimize
the risk of cancer 

23
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:09.000
the 2010 study found that rosemary is 
the number one most


00:01:09.000 -->
effective spice when it comes to
1:41
reducing the amount of carcinogenic
1:43
compounds you ingest from cooking ground
1:45
beef it's also known to have significant
1:47
antibacterial properties as well as
1:49
antifungal properties which makes it a
1:51
good home remedy for yeast infections if
1:53
you have a bacterial infection though
1:55
time may actually be the way to go many
1:57
studies have touted thyme oil as an
1:59
effective inhibitor of harmful bacterial
2:01
growth in raw poultry so if you were to
2:04
marinade chicken in essential thyme oil
2:06
you could greatly extend its shelf life
2:08
it's even being considered as a possible
2:10
alternative treatment for antibiotic
2:12
resistant
2:13
like MRSA that plus it's
2:14
anti-inflammatory properties make time
2:17
one of the best home remedies for acne
2:18
and speaking of anti-inflammatories
2:21
ginger is also one of the most effective
2:23
natural ones out there it contains two
2:25
key phytochemicals known to fight
2:27
inflammation which is why you typically
2:28
see it used in teas for people
2:30
congestion or sore throat it's also
2:32
great for arthritis and research
2:34
published in the Journal of pain shows
2:35
that daily supplements containing 2
2:37
grams of ginger can actually ease muscle
2:39
pain from exercising by 25% if pain is a
2:42
common problem for you then you may also
2:44
be interested to know that Chili Peppers
2:45
are great analgesics the active
2:48
component in them is called capsaicin
2:50
and it's been shown over time to reduce
2:51
certain pain causing neurotransmitters
2:54
it's currently used in topical form for
2:56
all kinds of health problems ranging
2:57
from post surgical pain to arthritis
2:59
even things like psoriasis and if that
3:01
is not enough it's also known to cause
3:03
weight loss a 2009 study found that
3:06
capsaicin can actually alter key
3:07
proteins found in fat making it a
3:09
natural and viable method for reducing
3:12
abdominal fat of course these are just a
3:14
small handful of spices that are good
3:15
for your health but there's actually way
3:17
more oregano garlic nutmeg and a bunch
3:20
of others all have their own unique
3:21
health benefits so eat up maybe you can
3:24
