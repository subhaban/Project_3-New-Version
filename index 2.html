				<h2>Spices and its benefits</h2>
				<p>spices they're good for the soul but they're also good for our bodies
					Hey guys ,Tara here for dnews and if you're a person who enjoys cooking or eating then you'll be
					happy to know that many of the spices we use in our food everyday can also have very real health
					benefits. A new study from the Rush University Medical Center finds that cinnamon can actually
					reverse the anatomical changes that occur in the brains of mice with Parkinson's disease. Cinnamon
					has long been known to be great for your health it's loaded with antioxidants and it's especially
					helpful for people with type 2 diabetes.A 2010 study found that consuming two grams of cinnamon
					every day for 12 weeks significantly lowered patient's blood pressure and blood sugar levels. In
					another study from that same year found that cinnamon extract can actually increase insulin.
					Turmeric for example which is found in a lot of Indian food may actually help fight cancer it
					contains an antioxidant called curcumin that's been shown to enhance the effectiveness of chemo in
					patients with breast cancer so much in fact that it's now being considered as a possible drug
					supplement for chemotherapy it's also been shown to suppress the specific cell pathway that's known
					to fuel the growth of head and neck cancer .Rosemary has also been shown to minimize the risk of
					cancer the 2010 study found that rosemary is the number one most effective spice when it comes to
					reducing the amount of carcinogenic compounds you ingest from cooking groundnbeef it's also known to
					have significant antibacterial properties as well as antifungal properties which makes it a good
					home remedy for yeast infections. If you have a bacterial infection though time effective inhibitor
					of harmful bacterial growth in raw poultry so if you were to marinade chicken in essential thyme oil
					you could greatly extend its shelf life it's even being considered as a possible alternative
					treatment for antibiotic resistant like MRSA that plus it's anti-inflammatory properties make time
					one of the best home remedies for acne and speaking of anti-inflammatories ginger is also one of the
					most effective natural ones out there it contains two key phytochemicals known to fight inflammation
					which is why you typically see it used in teas for people congestion or sore throat it's also great
					for arthritis and research published in the Journal of pain shows that daily supplements containing
					2 grams of ginger can actually ease muscle pain from exercising by 25% if pain is a common problem
					for you then you may also be interested to know that Chili Peppers are great analgesics the active
					component in them is called capsaicin and it's been shown over time to reduce certain pain causing
					neurotransmitters it's currently used in topical form for all kinds of health problems ranging from
					post surgical pain to arthritis even things like psoriasis and if that is not enough it's also known
					to cause weight loss a 2009 study found that capsaicin can actually alter key proteins found in fat
					making it a natural and viable method for reducing abdominal fat of course these are just a small
					handful of spices that are good for your health but there's actually way more oregano garlic nutmeg
					and a bunch of others all have their own unique health benefits so eat up maybe you can stave off
					cancer probably not but it won't hurt right if you're interested in cramming your brain with even
					more knowledge then let me remind you guys that we have a new show hosted by trace and myself called
					test-tube that's like dnews but for current events we just put up a new episode today on the current
					situation surrounding gang violence in Chicago so if that is something you've nbeen wanting more
					clarification on go watch that episode in the meantime let us know in the comments below what your
					favorite spice is personally I'm a fan of nutmeg it's also great in sangria as always thank you guys
